# Codebase Review Summary

This document summarizes the structure and key features of the portfolio website codebase.

*   **Project Type:** Static portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Structure:**
    *   Main Page: `index.html`
    *   Styles: Primarily in `css/styles.css`, with component-specific CSS in `css/components/` (`cta-button.css`, `footer.css`).
    *   JavaScript: Mainly in `js/main.js`, with component logic in `js/components/` (`cta-button.js`).
    *   Components: HTML template for `<cta-button>` in `components/cta-button.html`.
    *   Assets: `images/` directory.
    *   Portfolio Projects: Likely individual HTML pages in `work/`.
*   **Key Features & Implementation:**
    *   **Custom Component:** `<cta-button>` defined using vanilla JS and CSS.
    *   **Styling:** Uses CSS variables, Google Fonts (Inter, Poppins), Font Awesome icons. `styles.css` is large and includes styles for base elements, sections, components, project pages, modals, and extensive responsive rules.
    *   **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Handles interactions like:
        *   Hero section parallax.
        *   Smooth scrolling.
        *   Portfolio "Show More".
        *   Testimonials carousel.
        *   Fade-in animations on scroll.
        *   Text reveal animation on scroll.
        *   Mobile button visibility.
        *   *Note:* Contains commented-out/disabled code for mobile navigation and FAQ accordion.
    *   **Potential Redundancy/Legacy Code:**
        *   Overlapping button styles (`cta-button.css` vs. `styles.css`).
        *   Unused footer styles in `css/components/footer.css` (different implementation in `index.html`/`styles.css`).
        *   Styles in `styles.css` for sections not present in `index.html` (Pricing, FAQ, Company Logos).
        *   Multiple or disabled implementations in `main.js` (testimonials carousel, portfolio loading).
*   **Dependencies:** External CDN links for Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
